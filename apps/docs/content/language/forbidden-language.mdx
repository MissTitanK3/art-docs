# Forbidden Language

## Institutional and Authority-Encoded Language

The following language patterns create fear, confusion, or imply that expertise is required to proceed. They are explicitly forbidden in crisis-facing interfaces.

---

## Forbidden Terms and Patterns

### Role-Specific Jargon

**Forbidden:**
- `dispatcher_admin`
- `regional_admin`
- `role:authenticated_user`
- "Required roles"
- "Authorized personnel only"

**Why:** Implies you need to know organizational structure to use the system.

**Use instead:**
- "Dispatchers only"
- "Coordinators can see this"
- "Who can help"
- "Only you and dispatchers can see this"

---

### Database and Technical Terms

**Forbidden:**
- "Validate"
- "Schema"
- "Persist"
- "Entity"
- "Status: Open"
- "Priority Level"
- "Submitted at [timestamp]"
- "Record updated"

**Why:** Exposes internal system architecture. Users don't care about databases.

**Use instead:**
- "Check"
- (Never expose this concept)
- "Save"
- "Dispatch," "Report," "Person"
- "Still needs response"
- "How urgent"
- "Sent 3 minutes ago"
- "Changed by Alex"

---

### Bureaucratic Formality

**Forbidden:**
- "Submit a request for support"
- "Intended actions"
- "Confirm incident classification"
- "Acknowledge receipt"
- "Escalation protocol initiated"

**Why:** Creates cognitive distance. Sounds like paperwork, not help.

**Use instead:**
- "Let people know something's happening"
- "What needs to happen"
- "What's going on?"
- "Got it"
- "We're notifying more people"

---

### Precision Demands

**Forbidden:**
- "Enter exact coordinates"
- "Confirm incident type"
- "Select category"
- "Specify threat level"
- "Define scope"

**Why:** Forces premature categorization. Creates paralysis.

**Use instead:**
- "Where is this happening?"
- "What's going on? (A few words is enough)"
- "Tags (optional)"
- "How urgent is this?"
- "Describe what you know"

---

### Blame or Error Language

**Forbidden:**
- "Invalid input"
- "Incorrect format"
- "Failed to submit"
- "User error"
- "Access denied"
- "Unauthorized"
- "False alarm"

**Why:** Implies user fault. Creates shame and fear.

**Use instead:**
- "We need this to be in the format: ..."
- "This needs to look like: ..."
- "This couldn't be sent. [What happened] [Try again]"
- "Something went wrong on our end"
- "You don't have permission to see this"
- "This area is restricted"
- "Turned out to be okay"

---

### Ownership and Hierarchy Language

**Forbidden:**
- "Assigned to"
- "Your responsibility"
- "Take ownership"
- "Claim this dispatch"
- "Report to [person]"
- "Chain of command"
- "Authorization required"

**Why:** Implies hierarchy. This system has no command structure.

**Use instead:**
- "[Name] is responding"
- "You can help with this"
- "I'm heading there"
- "I'm responding"
- "Check in with [person]"
- "Ask [person]"
- "Only [role] can do this"

---

### Ambiguous Status Language

**Forbidden:**
- "Pending"
- "In progress"
- "Awaiting response"
- "Under review"
- "Queued"

**Why:** Doesn't explain what's actually happening. Creates anxiety.

**Use instead:**
- "We're checking on this"
- "[Name] is on their way"
- "No one has responded yet"
- "[Name] is looking at this"
- "This will send when you're back online"

---

### Jargon from Emergency Services

**Forbidden:**
- "10-4"
- "Signal 13"
- "Code [anything]"
- "ETA"
- "Incident commander"
- "Scene secure"
- "Triage priority"

**Why:** This is not professional emergency response. Using professional jargon creates false expectations and intimidates non-professionals.

**Use instead:**
- "Got it" or "Okay"
- Plain language description
- Plain language description
- "Should be there in [time]"
- "Coordinating" (if anyone is)
- "Situation is stable"
- "How urgent"

---

### ALL CAPS and Excessive Punctuation

**Forbidden:**
- "URGENT"
- "EMERGENCY!!!"
- "IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED"
- "WARNING!!!"

**Why:** Amplifies panic. The situation is already urgent.

**Use instead:**
- "Urgent" (regular case)
- "Emergency" (regular case)
- "Someone is in danger right now" (clear, factual)
- "Heads up" or "Important"

---

## Forbidden UI Patterns

### Mystery Buttons

**Forbidden:**
- [Confirm] (with no explanation)
- [Submit]
- [OK]
- [Proceed]

**Why:** Users don't know what will happen.

**Use instead:**
- [Send Report] + preview of what's being sent
- [Close This] + "Anyone can reopen it"
- [Got it]
- [Send to 12 people nearby]

---

### Unexplained Wait States

**Forbidden:**
- "Loading..." (with no context)
- [Spinner with no text]
- "Please wait"

**Why:** Silence during wait creates fear that something broke.

**Use instead:**
- "Checking for open situations..."
- "Finding people nearby..." (with spinner)
- "This takes a few seconds. Checking..." 

---

### Implied Permanence

**Forbidden:**
- "This cannot be undone"
- "Final submission"
- "Irreversible action"
- "Delete forever"

**Why:** Creates fear of making mistakes. Most things should be reversible.

**Use instead:**
- "You can reopen this later if needed"
- "Send report" (not "final")
- "You can undo this for the next 15 minutes"
- "Remove" + "You can restore this from history"

---

## Testing for Forbidden Language

Before deploying any UI text, check:

1. **Could this appear on a government form?** → Rewrite
2. **Would a 12-year-old understand this?** → If no, rewrite
3. **Does this require knowing someone's job title?** → Rewrite
4. **Does this sound like a database error?** → Rewrite
5. **Would this make someone hesitate?** → Rewrite

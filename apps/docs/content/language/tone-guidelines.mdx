# Tone Guidelines

## Framing Principles

The language in this system must convey **permission, safety, and reversibility** rather than authority, precision, or institutional control.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Use Verbs Over Nouns

**Why:** Verbs imply action and agency. Nouns create distance and formality.

- ✅ "Report something"
- ❌ "Create a report"

- ✅ "Ask for help"
- ❌ "Submit a need"

#### 2. Use Outcomes Over Actions

**Why:** Users care about the result, not the technical process.

- ✅ "People can see this now"
- ❌ "Report submitted"

- ✅ "Your message is on its way"
- ❌ "Queued for sync"

#### 3. Use Permission Over Instruction

**Why:** Permission reduces fear of making mistakes. Instructions create compliance anxiety.

- ✅ "You can change this anytime"
- ❌ "Edit your submission"

- ✅ "You can stop and come back later"
- ❌ "Save draft"

#### 4. Calm Interface, Urgent Situation

**Why:** The situation is already urgent. The UI should be a calming force, not amplify stress.

- ✅ "Someone is in danger right now" (clear, factual)
- ❌ "CRITICAL EMERGENCY!!!" (panic-inducing)

- ✅ "Needs help soon" (directional)
- ❌ "URGENT: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED" (overwhelming)

**Avoid:**
- ALL CAPS (except acronyms like GPS)
- Exclamation points (except when celebrating success)
- Red text for anything except true errors
- Countdown timers that create artificial urgency
- Loading spinners without explanatory text

#### 5. Concrete Over Abstract

**Why:** Abstract language requires interpretation. Under stress, interpretation capacity drops to zero.

- ✅ "3 dispatchers online right now"
- ❌ "Adequate coverage"

- ✅ "Last seen 4 minutes ago"
- ❌ "Recent activity"

#### 6. Uncertainty Is Acceptable

**Why:** Forcing false certainty creates analysis paralysis. Let users express doubt.

- ✅ "I'm not sure, but I think..."
- ❌ "Confirm incident type"

- ✅ "Approximate is fine"
- ❌ "Enter exact location"

#### 7. Explain Consequences Before Actions

**Why:** Fear of the unknown prevents action. Make outcomes predictable.

- ✅ "This will notify 12 people nearby" → [Send]
- ❌ [Confirm]

- ✅ "This will close the dispatch. Anyone can reopen it." → [Close]
- ❌ [Close Dispatch]

## Voice and Vocabulary

### Default Voice: Supportive Peer

Write as if you are a calm, experienced friend helping someone through a stressful moment. Not as a system, authority, or institution.

**Examples:**

| Institutional Voice | Supportive Peer Voice |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| "Submission received at 14:32:18 UTC" | "Got it. People can see this now." |
| "Validation error: Required field missing" | "We need to know where this is happening" |
| "Dispatch status updated to closed" | "This is marked as resolved. Thanks for the update." |
| "Unauthorized access attempt" | "You don't have permission to see this. Need help?" |

### Vocabulary Guidelines

| Instead of... | Use... | Why |
| ------------- | ------ | --- |
| Submit | Send, Share | "Submit" is bureaucratic |
| Request | Report, Ask | "Request" implies a hierarchy |
| Validate | Check | "Validate" is technical jargon |
| Status | What's happening | "Status" is database language |
| Priority | How urgent | "Priority" implies a queue |
| Assign | Ask [name] | "Assign" is task management language |
| Confirm | Ready? | "Confirm" creates anxiety about correctness |
| Cancel | Stop, Go back | "Cancel" feels like failure |
| Error | Something went wrong | "Error" implies user fault |

## Contextual Tone Shifts

### During Active Crisis (Dispatch Entry, Response)
- **Minimal words, maximum clarity**
- **No explanations unless requested**
- **Every word earns its place**

Example: "Where?" (not "Please enter the location of the incident")

### During Review or Analysis (History, Filters, Reports)
- **More context is helpful**
- **Explain what data means**
- **Educational tone is appropriate**

Example: "This shows all dispatches from the past 7 days. Red dots are still open."

### During Errors or Failures
- **Never blame the user**
- **Always explain what to do next**
- **Offer a way out**

Example: "This couldn't be saved. Your internet connection dropped. We'll try again in a moment, or you can tap 'Retry now.'"

## Copy Testing Checklist

Before deploying any UI text, ask:

1. **Would a stressed, non-technical person understand this in under 3 seconds?**
2. **Does this increase or reduce fear?**
3. **Is there a simpler word?**
4. **Does this explain what happens next?**
5. **Would this make sense to someone who's never used the system?**
6. **Does this sound like a helpful human or a database?**
7. **Can this be cut in half without losing meaning?**

If the answer to any question is "no" or "I'm not sure," rewrite.

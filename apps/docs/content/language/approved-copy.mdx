# Language and Framing Corrections

## Current → Revised

| Current Language | Problem | Revised Language |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| "Team Request" | Implies you must know what team | "Report something" |
| "Submit a request for support" | Formal, bureaucratic | "Let people know something's happening" |
| "Dispatch Map" | Jargon | "Active situations" |
| "Community Watch" | Ambiguous | "What people are seeing" |
| "Confirmed Watch" | Implies unconfirmed is suspect | "Verified reports" |
| "Dispatcher Schedules" | Role-specific | "Who's on duty" |
| "Intended Actions" | Legalistic | "What needs to happen" |
| "Required Roles" | Implies expertise | "Who can help" |
| "Submit a Need" | Transactional | "Ask for help" |
| "Urgency: Normal" | What's normal in a crisis? | "Needs help soon" |
| "Status: Open" | Database term | "Still needs response" |
| "Visibility: role:dispatcher_admin" | Incomprehensible | "Who can see this: Dispatchers only" |
| "Filters" | Technical | "Show me..." |
| "Loading dispatch submissions..." | System-focused | "Checking for open situations..." |

## Framing Principles

- Use **verbs over nouns** ("Report something" not "Create a report")
- Use **outcomes over actions** ("People can see this now" not "Report submitted")
- Use **permission over instruction** ("You can change this anytime" not "Edit your submission")
- Avoid all-caps, exclamation points, and urgent language (the situation is urgent; the UI should be calm)

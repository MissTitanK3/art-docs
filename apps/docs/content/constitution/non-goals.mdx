# Explicit Non-Goals

This system is **not** trying to be:

| Non-Goal | Why |
| -------- | --- |
| **A replacement for 911** | We do not dispatch professional emergency services. We coordinate mutual aid. |
| **A task assignment system** | No one is assigned tasks. People volunteer presence. |
| **A compliance tracker** | We do not enforce policy. We enable coordination. |
| **A command-and-control platform** | There is no hierarchy. Visibility replaces authority. |
| **A performance management tool** | We do not track who responded fastest or most often for evaluation purposes. |
| **A public-facing crisis map** | This is for authenticated responders, not general public consumption. |

Stating non-goals prevents scope creep. When someone proposes a feature that drifts toward these, this document says "that's a different system."

This document should be treated as policy. Engineers, admins, and responders may cite it in disagreements. That is intentional.

# System Constitution

## Design Anti-Patterns Explicitly Rejected

This review identifies and rejects several recurring design patterns that increase cognitive load and suppress reporting under stress. These patterns are common in complex systems and, increasingly, in AI-oriented interfaces. They are inappropriate for human-centered dispatch.

### Context Exhaustion UX

**Description:** Interfaces that demand full context, categorization, and precision upfront, before the user understands the situation themselves.

**Why it appears:** Often optimized for systems that need structured input early, including analytics pipelines, dashboards, or AI models that benefit from complete context windows.

**Why it fails here:** People in crisis do not have a complete mental model. Forcing early structure creates paralysis, abandonment, or inaccurate data.

**Our rejection:** Dispatch accepts partial, ambiguous, and evolving information. Structure is optional and additive, never required at entry.

### Completeness-First Design

**Description:** Workflows that prioritize "getting all the fields filled out" over enabling timely action.

**Why it appears:** Optimizes for data hygiene, reporting, and backend certainty.

**Why it fails here:** Completeness delays action. In emergencies, incomplete information is better than no information.

**Our rejection:** A dispatch exists as soon as a location exists. Everything else is enrichment.

### Premature Categorization

**Description:** Requiring users to select types, presets, teams, or roles before they understand what is happening.

**Why it appears:** Reflects internal taxonomies rather than user reality.

**Why it fails here:** Users guess or freeze. Both outcomes degrade system trust.

**Our rejection:** Free-text description precedes categorization. Categories are suggested, never demanded.

### Institutional and Authority-Encoded Language

**Description:** Language that implies permission, expertise, or correctness is required to proceed.

**Why it appears:** Inherited from administrative, enterprise, or compliance-driven systems.

**Why it fails here:** Creates fear of "doing it wrong," especially for non-professionals.

**Our rejection:** Language emphasizes permission, reversibility, and shared responsibility.

### Dashboard-First Thinking

**Description:** Design optimized for monitoring, filtering, and analysis rather than initiation.

**Why it appears:** Built by and for experienced operators.

**Why it fails here:** First-time users under stress encounter too many decisions too early.

**Our rejection:** Initiation flows are minimal. Analysis tools are hidden until explicitly requested.

### Silent System State

**Description:** Systems that assume users will infer success, failure, or progress.

**Why it appears:** Engineering-centric assumptions about happy paths.

**Why it fails here:** Silence is interpreted as failure or abandonment.

**Our rejection:** All actions confirm success or explain failure. Silence is treated as a bug.

**Guiding Statement:** This system is intentionally human-paced, ambiguity-tolerant, and forgiveness-oriented. It is designed for people who are uncertain, stressed, and acting in good faith. Not for systems that demand perfect context.

## Design Principles for Dispatch Simplification

### 1. "A dispatch exists even if incomplete."

Once a location is captured, the dispatch is real. Everything else is enrichment.

### 2. "Never require precision before understanding."

Users cannot categorize, label, or sort what they don't yet understand. Let them describe first, categorize later (or never).

### 3. "Assume nothing is known until proven otherwise."

Default all optional fields to "unknown" or "pending." Do not force the user to guess or invent data.

### 4. "Visibility of system state reduces fear."

Show what's happening: "3 dispatchers online," "Report seen by 2 people," "Last update 4 min ago." Silence is terrifying.

### 5. "The cost of backtracking must be near zero."

If editing, canceling, or correcting a submission feels irreversible or shameful, users will abandon rather than risk being wrong.

### 6. "Offline behavior must be predictable."

The system should queue submissions when offline and clearly indicate sync status. "This will send when you're back online" is acceptable. Silent failure is not.

### 7. "Cognitive load is measured in decisions, not fields."

A single open-ended text box is less taxing than three dropdowns. Reduce decisions, not inputs.

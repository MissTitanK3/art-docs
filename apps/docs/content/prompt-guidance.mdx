# Prompt Guidance

## Master Prompt: Feature-Based Roadmap Documentation

**Purpose**  
Generate and maintain a feature-based sprint roadmap. Sprints are not time-bound. Each sprint delivers a foundational capability that enables the next sprint. Documentation must emphasize dependency flow, invariants, and forward momentum.

**Context You Should Assume**

- This project uses feature-based sprints, not time-based sprints.
- Each sprint exists to unlock or stabilize the next sprint.
- Documentation lives under:

```
roadmap/
├── roadmap-overview.mdx
└── sprints/
    ├── sprint_one.mdx
    ├── sprint_two.mdx (future)
    └── ...
```

- Some sprints may later be expanded into sub-documents when:
  - A tangent emerges
  - A targeted implementation requires focus
  - An assumption proves incomplete
- Those sub-documents live alongside the sprint file and must be explicitly linked.

### Prompt Part 1: Roadmap Overview

Use this prompt to write or update `roadmap-overview.mdx`:

You are documenting a feature-based project roadmap. Write `roadmap-overview.mdx`.

**Requirements**

- Explain what a feature-based sprint is.
- Explicitly state that sprints are dependency-driven, not time-driven.
- Describe how each sprint supports and unlocks the next.
- Define when and why a sprint may gain sub-documents.
- Clarify how this roadmap keeps the project moving forward even when scope evolves.

**Constraints**

- Be precise. Avoid motivational language.
- Focus on system continuity, not velocity.
- Assume the reader is a future contributor or reviewer.

**Include sections**

1. Purpose of the Roadmap
2. How Feature-Based Sprints Work
3. Sprint Dependencies and Flow
4. Handling Scope Expansion and Tangents
5. How to Use This Roadmap Day-to-Day

### Prompt Part 2: Writing a Sprint

Use this prompt to create or update an individual sprint file, e.g. `sprint_one.mdx`:

You are documenting a single feature-based sprint. Write `sprint_<name>.mdx`.

**Context**

- This sprint exists to enable future sprints.
- It may depend on assumptions defined in earlier documentation.
- It must be complete enough that later work does not need to revisit its core decisions.

**Required sections**

1. Sprint Intent
   - What capability this sprint establishes
   - Why it must exist before later work
2. Dependencies
   - Prior sprints, specs, or invariants this relies on
   - What breaks if these assumptions are wrong
3. Scope and Non-Scope
   - What is explicitly included
   - What is explicitly excluded
4. Core Deliverables
   - Concrete outputs (docs, code paths, guarantees, behaviors)
   - Written so completion is unambiguous
5. Success Criteria
   - Conditions that must be true before moving on
   - No subjective language
6. Follow-On Enablement
   - What future sprints can now assume
   - What complexity has been removed or stabilized
7. Known Gaps or Risks
   - Anything intentionally deferred
   - Any edge cases acknowledged but not solved

**Constraints**

- No timelines.
- No estimates.
- No aspirational language.
- Write so another engineer could pick this up months later and continue.

### Prompt Part 3: Adding Sprint Sub-Documents

Use this when a sprint needs deeper focus: you are extending an existing sprint with a focused sub-document. Write a new MDX file linked from its parent sprint.

**Rules**

- The sub-document must not redefine sprint intent.
- It must solve or clarify one specific concern.
- It must clearly state why it exists separately.

**Include**

1. Problem or Gap Being Addressed
2. Why This Was Not Originally Scoped
3. Design or Implementation Details
4. Impact on the Parent Sprint
5. Any New Constraints Introduced

End with a clear statement of whether this sub-document changes sprint completion criteria.

### Usage Notes

- Always update the parent sprint to link sub-documents.
- Never retroactively change completed sprint intent.
- If a sprint must be revised, document the revision explicitly.

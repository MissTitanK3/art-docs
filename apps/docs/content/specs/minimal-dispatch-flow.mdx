# Minimal Dispatch Flow

**Constraints met:**

- ≤5 user decisions to start a response
- Plain, non-authoritative language
- Each step answers only one question

---

## Step 1: Entry Point

**User sees:**
> "Something happening? Tap to report."

**System captures:**

- Current timestamp (auto)
- User ID from session (auto)
- Entry source (manual/watch/map)

**System reassures:**
> "You're starting a report. You can stop anytime. Nothing is final until you say so."

---

## Step 2: Location

**User sees:**
> "Where is this happening?"
> [Map with circle radius] or [Use my location] or [Type an address]
> "Zoom in until you're not sure anymore. The circle shows the area."

**System captures:**

- Center latitude/longitude
- Radius (in meters, based on zoom level)
- Location label (reverse geocoded or user-entered)

**System reassures:**
> "Approximate is fine. You can update this later."

---

## Step 3: What's Happening

**User sees:**
> "What's going on? (A few words is enough)"
> [Large text input, no character limit]

**System captures:**

- Free-text description
- Optional: detected keywords for suggested tags

**System reassures:**
> "You don't need to have all the details. Write what you know."

---

## Step 4: Urgency

**User sees:**
> "How urgent is this?"
> [Three buttons:]
>
> - "They're okay for now"
> - "Needs help soon"
> - "Someone is in danger right now"

**System captures:**

- Urgency level (low / normal / critical)

**System reassures:**
> "If you're not sure, pick the middle one. We can adjust."

---

## Step 5: Confirm and Send

**User sees:**
> "Ready to send this?"
> [Summary card showing: location, description, urgency]
> [Send Report] [Edit Something]

**System captures:**

- Submission timestamp
- Status = "open"

**System reassures:**
> "Your report is live. People can see it now. You'll get a notification if someone responds."

---

### **Total decisions: 4**

1. Where?
2. What?
3. How urgent?
4. Send?

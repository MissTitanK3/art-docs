## Common Integration Points

### API → Database Mappings

```
POST /dispatches
  ↓
INSERT INTO dispatches (
  id, region_id, client_id,
  location_lat, location_lon,
  description, urgency, submitter_id
)

GET /dispatches?region=us-east-1&status=open
  ↓
SELECT * FROM dispatches
WHERE region_id = 'us-east-1'
  AND status IN ('open', 'acknowledged', 'escalated')
  AND is_deleted = FALSE
ORDER BY created_at DESC

PATCH /dispatches/:id (version=2)
  ↓
UPDATE dispatches
SET urgency = ?, version = version + 1
WHERE id = ? AND version = ? AND region_id = ?
```

All integration details documented in the individual spec files.

## Risk Status

### 🟢 Risks Mitigated (All Resolved ✓)

- "We don't know what to build" → B1 + B2 specify all
- "API and DB won't align" → Both resolved together 
- "Data will be lost" → Soft deletes + audit_log 
- "Concurrent updates will corrupt" → Versioning 
- "Idempotency won't work" → client_id strategy 
- "We don't know who can do what" → B3 Architecture [JWT + HttpOnly, 3 core roles]
- "Offline won't work" → B4 Architecture [Local queuing, exponential backoff, conflict resolution]
- "Multi-region infrastructure unclear" → B5 Architecture [3 US regions specified]
- "Feature scope creep" → B6 Strategy [Crisis + Management modes defined]

### ✨ No Risks Still Present

All critical blockers and architectural decisions are now complete. Implementation can proceed with confidence.

---

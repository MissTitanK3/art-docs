# Tabletop Scenarios for Constitution Compliance

These scenarios test whether the system adheres to its constitution under realistic stress conditions. Use them for design review, user testing, and post-deployment verification.

## How to Use These Scenarios

1. **Pick a scenario** relevant to your changes
2. **Walk through the flow** as if you are the user in the scenario
3. **Document friction points** where the system creates hesitation, confusion, or fear
4. **Verify invariants** are maintained throughout the flow
5. **Note any violations** of language guidelines or design principles

**Pass criteria:** User completes the task without external help, within target time, without expressed confusion or fear.

## Scenario 1: First-Time User Under Stress

### Context
**Actor:** Jamie, 19, college student, no prior dispatch experience

**Goal:** Report the situation and get help

### Success Criteria
- Completes dispatch submission in under 90 seconds
- Does not express confusion about what to do
- Does not abandon the form
- Receives clear confirmation that help is coming

### Test Flow
1. Jamie opens the app (no account yet, what happens?)

### Constitution Checks
- [ ] No required fields besides location

## Scenario Scoring

For each scenario, rate the experience:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pass** | User completed task without confusion, within target time, no constitution violations |
| **Pass with Friction** | User completed task but expressed confusion or hesitation; minor violations |
| **Fail** | User could not complete task, abandoned flow, or major constitution violations |

**Deployment gate:** No "Fail" ratings allowed. "Pass with Friction" requires documented follow-up fixes.

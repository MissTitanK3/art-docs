# Sprint 0: Dev -> Prod -> Region-Prod "Hello World"

**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Status:** **PLANNED**  
**Goal:** Prove the full deployment flow from local dev to prod to region-prod with a minimal "hello world".

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 0 is intentionally small. It validates the deployment pipeline and environment configuration by shipping a minimal "hello world" across:

- Local development
- Production (`www.alwaysreadytools.com`)
- Region deployments (pnw, wap)

No domain logic, no auth, no schema work. If a task is not a basic init or deployment proof, it moves to a later sprint.

---

## Sprint Intent
- Prove a clean, repeatable deploy path (dev -> prod -> regions).
- Establish environment config patterns that can be reused by all future sprints.
- Ship the smallest possible app/API that still exercises the full pipeline.

## Objective & Success Definition
**Objective:** Establish confidence in deployment mechanics and environment wiring before any complex implementation begins.

**Success is achieved when:**
- `apps/web` renders a "hello world" page in prod and region deployments
- Supabase `/rest/v1` (or `/health`) is reachable in prod and region deployments
- Runtime config resolves environment + region correctly (local/prod/pnw/wap)
- CI/CD can deploy without manual steps
- Each region deploy (pnw, wap) proves a distinct region value is observable in the response

---

## In Scope (Basic Inits Only)
- Minimal web page ("hello world")
- Supabase connectivity check (`/rest/v1` or `/health`)
- Environment configuration (local, prod, pnw, wap)
- CI/CD pipeline verification
- Region-specific deployment verification (pnw, wap)

## Out of Scope (Moved to Later Sprints)
- API contracts, database schema, and migrations
- Authentication, roles, and session management
- Offline support, queueing, or idempotency logic
- Region scope decisions beyond proving a region-prod target exists
- Crisis/management mode architecture
- Intake forms, dispatch flows, and UX components

## For Infra/Platform Team

### Phase A: Deployment Flow
1. **Set up environment targets**
   - Local, prod, pnw, wap
   - Ensure each region has a distinct region identifier
2. **CI/CD pipeline verification**
   - Deploy on merge to main
   - Verify smoke test runs for web and api

### Phase B: Runtime Configuration
3. **Define runtime config schema**
   - Required keys: `ENV_NAME`, `REGION_NAME`, `API_BASE_URL`
   - Enforce defaults for local
4. **Validate config propagation**
   - Confirm web + api read the same environment/region values

---

## For Frontend Team

### Phase A: Minimal Page
1. **Create "hello world" page**
   - Render page-level env + region value
2. **Wire to API**
   - Fetch Supabase endpoint and display response
3. **Deploy to prod and regions**
   - Confirm prod shows correct environment on page and API
   - Confirm pnw shows correct region on page and API
   - Confirm wap shows correct region on page and API

---

## For QA/Testing Team

### Smoke Test Plan
```
✓ Web page loads in prod (shows env + region)
✓ Web page loads in pnw region (shows env + region)
✓ Web page loads in wap region (shows env + region)
✓ Supabase endpoint returns 200 in prod with correct env/region
✓ Supabase endpoint returns 200 in pnw with correct env/region
✓ Supabase endpoint returns 200 in wap with correct env/region
✓ CI/CD pipeline runs without manual intervention
```

## Risks & Notes
- If env config differs between web and api, stop and fix before moving on
- If regions (pnw, wap) cannot be distinguished from prod, deployment is not valid
- If region-prod cannot be distinguished from prod, deployment is not valid

## Sprint Intent
- Provide a simple active-dispatch list and detail view with essential state only.
- Ensure responders can see what needs attention without heavy filters or navigation.
- Establish read-only UI patterns that later sprints will extend with signaling and error recovery.

## Objective & Success Definition
**Objective:** Create a transparent, minimal read interface for active dispatches that responders can scan quickly without extraneous information or complex controls.

**Success is achieved when:**
- Responders locate a relevant dispatch in < 30 seconds from page load
- All dispatch metadata is expressed in plain language (no jargon)
- Page structure clearly separates list from detail without page jumps
- List and detail views are fully responsive on mobile and desktop

## Framing the Unknowns
- **API Pagination:** Will the backend support cursor-based, offset, or server-side filtering? How many records per page?
- **Dispatch States:** What are all possible dispatch states, and which are considered "active"?
- **Metadata Abundance:** Which fields should appear in the list vs. detail view to minimize clutter?
- **Real-Time Updates:** Should the list auto-refresh, or does the user manually refresh?

## Primary Risks & Tradeoffs
**Risks:**
- Pagination/filtering bugs could make dispatches undiscoverable (mitigated by starting with simple list, no client-side filters)
- If status semantics are unclear, UI could show confusing state labels (mitigated by rigorous language review)
- Missing or slow-loading data leaves responders uncertain (mitigated by explicit loading/error states)

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Completeness vs. Minimalism:** Showing all fields provides context but overwhelms; showing only essentials is clean but may require detail view clicks
- **Auto-Refresh vs. Manual:** Auto-refresh keeps list current but consumes resources and adds complexity; manual refresh is simpler but users may see stale data

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (List View Foundation)
- Build list component that fetches and displays active dispatches
- Render essential columns only: intent, location, status, updated time
- Implement pagination controls or "load more" affordance
- Add loading/error/empty states with clear messaging

### Phase 2 (Detail View)
- Create detail page/route for individual dispatch at `/dispatches/[id]`
- Wire to single-dispatch API endpoint
- Display key metadata (intent, location, submitter, timestamp, current status)
- Include navigation back to list; maintain scroll position if possible

### Phase 3 (Responsive Design & Language)
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design across list and detail views
- Review all state labels and helper text against tone guidelines
- Ensure plain language throughout; no institutional jargon
- Test navigation flow between list and detail across device sizes

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** React/Next.js (route for detail: `/dispatches/[id]` or modal overlay)
- **API Delivery:** Next.js API routes (same app); no separate backend service this sprint
- **Data Fetching:** React hooks (`useEffect`), Suspense or loader functions in Next.js
- **State Management:** React hooks or lightweight store (avoid Redux if not needed)
- **Styling:** CSS modules or Tailwind (match Sprint 1 patterns)
- **API Communication:** Fetch or axios using `runtimeConfig`
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first (responders may use phones in field)

## Dependencies
- **Sprint 0 Complete:** All 6 blockers resolved ([API](/specs/backend-api-contracts), [Schema](/specs/database-schema), [Auth](/specs/authentication-architecture), [Offline](/specs/offline-support-architecture), [Regions](/specs/region-scope-architecture), [Modes](/specs/crisis-management-mode-strategy))
- **Sprint 1 Complete:** Intake form deployed; dispatch records created with intent, location, submitter, timestamp
- **Runtime Config:** API base URL and domains configured per environment via `runtimeConfig`
- **Backend Delivery:** Next.js API routes within the web app (no dedicated backend server for Sprint 2)
- **Auth:** Users authenticated with JWT; submitter_id and roles available from session ([Auth Spec](/specs/authentication-architecture))
- **API Endpoints:** `GET /dispatches?active=true&limit=20&offset=0` and `GET /dispatches/:id` available and tested

## Scope and Non-Scope
**Scope:**
- Active dispatch list with minimal columns (intent/summary, location, status, updated time).
- Lightweight detail view for a single dispatch (include key metadata and history if available). For authenticated users, show intent/summary, location, submitter, timestamps, current status, and any available history (read-only).
- Basic empty state and loading/error states.
- Pagination or "load more" affordance (backend-driven pagination only; no client-side filtering).
- Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop.

**Non-Scope:**
- Notifications and responder signaling ("I'm responding") handled in Sprint 3.
- Advanced filtering, sorting, or client-side search controls.
- Offline caching or retry (later sprints).
- Real-time list updates or WebSocket subscriptions.

## Core Deliverables
- List view wired to `runtimeConfig` API base for active dispatches with pagination.
- Detail view page/route for a selected dispatch with essential fields and navigation.
- Clear empty state ("No active dispatches") and error state with retry affordance.
- Minimal status indicator (e.g., active/closed) matching API contract.
- **Copy aligned with constitution language rules** (no forbidden terms; labels and states inherit Sprint 1 approved patterns).
- Responsive layout tested on common mobile and desktop viewports.

## Success Criteria
-  Active dispatches render from the configured API; failures surface actionable errors.
-  The list shows only essential fields; no heavy filter UI present.
-  Selecting a dispatch loads its detail view smoothly (route transition or modal).
-  Pagination/load more affordance functions correctly; no data duplication.
-  Empty and error states are explicit and non-ambiguous.
-  Responsive design verified on iPhone 12, iPad, and desktop (1440px).
-  **Language compliance**: All view strings (status labels, empty states, errors) use plain language; no jargon or institutional terms.

## Follow-On Enablement
- Sprint 3 can add responder signaling and notifications on top of this view.
- Later sprints can layer filters/pagination without reworking core list/detail wiring.
- Data shown here establishes the baseline for audit and guardrail work in later sprints.

## Known Gaps or Risks
- API shape changes could affect list/detail field mapping; isolate mapping logic for quick updates.
- If status semantics are unclear, document assumptions and revisit in later guardrail sprints.
- Pagination performance at scale (1000+ dispatches) not tested; mitigate by server-side filtering.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will the list auto-refresh to show new dispatches?**  
A: No. Users manually refresh the list in Sprint 2. Sprint 3 will add notification support for real-time updates.

**Q: What happens if I'm on the detail view and someone updates the dispatch?**  
A: The detail view shows stale data until you refresh. Sprint 3+ will add real-time sync.

**Q: Can I filter or search dispatches in Sprint 2?**  
A: No. Sprint 2 is read-only with no filters. Sprint 3+ may add advanced filtering.

**Q: Is pagination automatic (infinite scroll) or manual (next button)?**  
A: Manual pagination with next/previous buttons. This reduces complexity and server load.

**Q: What if a dispatch is deleted while I'm viewing it?**  
A: Detail view shows a 404 error with a link back to the list.

**Q: Are list and detail views responsive on mobile?**  
A: Yes. Both views are mobile-first and tested on iPhone 12, iPad, and desktop.
